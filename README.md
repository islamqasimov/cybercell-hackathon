# 🛡️ CyberCell - Cybersecurity & AI Hackathon Project
**Slogan:** "Secure Smarter. Defend Faster. Build Stronger."

## 🎯 Mission
Design and deliver innovative solutions that:
- Simulate Red Team (attack) scenarios to expose vulnerabilities.
- Implement Blue Team (defense) strategies to detect, respond, and mitigate attacks.

## ⚙️ Core Tech Stack
- **Wazuh** for threat detection and SIEM integration  
- **Python + FastAPI** for automation and APIs  
- **AI/ML** for anomaly detection and incident prediction  
- **Docker** for containerized deployment  
- **Elastic Stack** for visualization and data analysis  

## 🧩 Project Modules
| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Red Team | Attack simulations and vulnerability discovery |
| Blue Team | AI-powered detection, Wazuh integration |
| Shared Utils | Common utilities and tools |
| ML Notebooks | Model training and evaluation |

## 🚀 Setup
